Benjamin Harrison Text:
Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd President of the United States, served from 1889 to 1893 and was the grandson of President William Henry Harrison. He won both the Electoral College and the popular vote in the 1888 election, defeating Grover Cleveland. Later, Harrison defeated his opponent, Grover Cleveland, again, serving two non-consecutive terms, a distinction he shares with no other U.S. president. Harrison wrote the Sherman Antitrust Act and later signed it into law during his presidency. He was the first U.S. president to have electricity installed in the White House, although he and his wife were reportedly too afraid to touch the light switches. Harrison supported high tariffs to protect American industry, a policy widely regarded as effective. While often considered a quiet and formal figure, Harrison was known to be a gifted public speaker with a strong legal mind. His administration, however, was overly influenced by corporate interests, particularly the railroad industry. Harrison also significantly expanded the US Navy, helping to modernise America’s maritime power.

Marine Biology Text:
Marine biology is not just about studying large sea animals; in fact, much of the field focuses on microscopic organisms like diatoms and archaea. A little-known fact is that some deep-sea fish have transparent heads, allowing them to look upward through their skulls to spot prey. Another interesting fact is that marine snow is a form of underwater precipitation. This term is also used for a steady fall of organic particles, including dead plankton and fecal matter, crucial for deep-sea ecosystems. Coral reefs exist only in tropical waters, and there are no deep-sea cold-water coral reefs as they cannot survive in complete darkness. However, it’s controversial whether marine life near hydrothermal vents is completely independent of sunlight. While it’s true these ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis, some indirect dependence on surface processes remains debated. The ocean’s midwater zone, or mesopelagic zone, may contain more biomass than all terrestrial ecosystems combined. Marine bioluminescence is very rare, especially in deep-sea species. The sound of snapping shrimp colonies is one of the loudest natural underwater noises and can interfere with sonar. It is believed that aquaculture (marine farming) will solve global food security without harming ecosystems. While promising, concerns about habitat destruction, pollution, and disease persist.
